            to create easy jumps from  section to section & to separate sections on my page.
            As I incorporate CSS and Javascript, I will make these sections their own pages,
            but for simplicity, let's leave these on the same page-->

            <!-- Add <p> About Me! Name, Age, Where I Live, things I studied In College,

                Favorite Food: I think it's a tie between Mussels & Sandwiches

            <!-- Might need to add a photo... <img src = " " /> -->

         <div id "music"> 
             <h2> Music </h3> 
         <!-- Talk about the music that I like to listen to
             Use Unordered Lists <ul> to rank the music genres I enjoy the most -->
             <p> When it comes to music, I would say that I listen to a lot of different genres,
                but there are only a few genres that I truly believe have my heart.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Korean R&B</li>
                    <li> R&B </li>
                    <li> Korean Pop Music (K-Pop)</li>
                    <li> Alternative Music </li>
                    <li> Pinkpantheress (she has her own genre of music)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                I put <span> Korean R&B </span> as my number one, because if I am being honest,
                I might not underdstand everything being said, but I feel it. My current favorite
                song at the moment is 
                <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smLDBuMv6VE"> Miracle </a> by SOULBYSEL ft Sumin.
                You can just hear the passion in the song. If you want to see more of my music taste,
                click the links in the ordered list above.
                <!-- Instead of links to favorite artists, I should just probably link the categories to playlists-->
             </p>
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <div id = "fashion"> 
            <h2> Fashion</h2> 
        <!-- Talk about my love for fashion and express some styles I use
            Use the <a> element to link to a pinterest board for each fashion style-->
            <p> When it comes to fashion, I would say I have a multitude of different styles. I enjoy dressing up,
                and I enjoy discovering a piece of my identity in the clothes I wear. My style oftern changes
                and trends come and go, I just know that at the current moment, I can put my style in three categories:
                <br>
                <br>
                <!-- Adding a break so I can create space in text & section off the placement of where I want to add photos
                     and pinterest links to the page. -->
                I think the best way to describe my style is a mixture of 
                <span> Office Siren, </span> <span> y2k,</span> and <span> the baddie aesthetic. </span>
            
                Sometimes I imagine myself as a model as I walk down the street, because my outfits are really killer.
                I would say my signature makeup style is white eyebrows. A look is ALWAYS incomplete without white eyebrows.

        <!-- Talk about my history with coding. What i hope to make out of this page, etc.
            Let's start by linking this section to my GitHub Page <a> -->
            <p> I actually have been coding since I was 15. I have experience with 
                Python, SQL, Java, HTML (that's how I made this), CSS, and Javascript. 
                However, my proficiency in these each coding languages over the years vary.

        <div id = "languages" > 
            <h2> Language Learning </h2> 
        <!-- Talk about all the languages I've tried to learn,
            then use an ordered lists to show which languages I'm the most to least proficient I'm in 
            In the future, i would like to take placement levels for these languages, 
            and then broadcast the level of certification I have, but for now, a list is okay. -->
            <p> I take pleasure in learning launguages, but there are over 100 in the world.
                I wish I had more time to learn more languages,
                (because this is a global world and knowing more than one language to communicate is a must).
                However, here are the ones I do know, in order from most fluent to lease fluent.
                <br>
            <!-- Ordered list for the languages: English (Fluent), Japanese(Intermediate), Korean (beginner), Spanish (beginner) -->

                <br>
                I want to take time to level up my language skills and hopefully add Chinese to the list of languages I am learning.
                Practicing is somewhat difficult, especially when many people around me only speak English, so I use a few resources.
            <!-- Possibly, add the resources I use... 
                may be a tad bit tedious, so maybe creating another HTML page for the languages resources is needed-->

            link the brokekpopgirls tiktok & Instagram, and then link my own individual Instagram page.
            Link our most recent and popular videos.
            In the future, I am going to make a website for the girls and I's group page, 
            but for now, linking to the socials are okay. -->
            <p> I would say that I spend half of my time on social media. 
                Since Covid, I have been using the interent to interact with people around the world.
                Now that it has become part of our daily lives, I do use it often. I make content realetd to
                makeup, beauty, fashion, mental health, kpop, memes, knowledge about the world, activism, and just life in my eyes.
                I have three personal oages, and two pages that I share with friends. 
                I am thinking about making a Youtube channel and a podcast soon with my friends so they're coming soon! 
            <!-- Link The Instagrams & Tiktoks, Link "Youtube" (Put A Video )-->

            <h2> Gaming </h2>
        <!-- Added Gaming Section... I Love Gaming. Just going to list the video games I play in sections based of RPG-->

            <p> I love gaming. I like entering the digital world of the character I create and live their lives. 
                I would say right now I am obsessed with 
                "Speed Draw" on Roblox, Animal Crossing, Wuthering Waves, Honkai Starrail, and Pokemon.
                I want to get back in to playing horror games, but I do not want to play alone (haha).
