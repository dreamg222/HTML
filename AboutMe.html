            to the separate sections on my page.
            As I incorporate CSS and Javascript, I will make these sections their own pages,
            but for simplicity, let's leave these on the same page-->


        <div id = "basics"> 
            <h2> Basics </h2>
            <!-- Add <p> About Me! Name, Age, Where I Live, things I studied In College, 
            favorite color, favorite food and the purpose of this page-->

         <div id "music"> 
             <h2> Music </h3> 
         <!-- Talk about the music that I like to listen to
             Use Ordered Lists <ol> to rank the music genres I enjoy the most -->
             <p> When it comes to music, I would say that I listen to a lot of different genres,
                but there are only a few genres that I truly believe have my heart.
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> Korean R&B</li>
                    <li> R&B </li>
                    <li> Korean Pop Music (K-Pop)</li>
                    <li> Alternative Music </li>
                    <li> Pinkpantheress (she has her own genre of music)</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                I put <span> Korean R&B </span> as my number one, because if I am being honest,
                I might not underdstand everything being said, but I feel it. My current favorite
                song at the moment is 
                <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smLDBuMv6VE"> Miracle </a> by SOULBYSEL ft Sumin.
                You can just hear the passion in the song. If you want to see more of my music taste,
                click the links in the ordered list above.
                <!-- Instead of links to favorite artists, I should just probably link the categories to playlists-->
